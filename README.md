# Project Portfolio 3: Hangman

My Hangman game is a Python terminal game that runs on Heroku. The aim of the game is to guess the hidden word before the hangman image is completed.

* Find the link to the game [here](https://hangman-pp3-2024-2fbba5f87d9d.herokuapp.com/)

## How to Play

1. To start, there will be a hidden word displayed as underscores, with with an image of the Hangman, and the amount of lives you have.
2. You will be prompted to guess a letter.
3. If you guess correctly, the letter will be revealed in the relevant space. If you guess wrong, the hangman image will progress to the next stage, and you will lose a life.
4. You win by guessing all letters correctly.
5. If you run out of lives, and the hangman image is completed, you will lose the game.
6. Upon win or lose you will be greeted with the relevant message and will be prompted to either restart the game, or quit.
